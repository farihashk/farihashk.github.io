      <h3>Task 1: Responsibilities and Qualifications of a Solutions Architect</h3>
      <p>Common qualifications that I came across were:
        <ul> <li>SQL </li>  <li>MATLAB </li>  <li> Some sort of DBMS skills like Microsoft SQL, Azure  </li>  <li> A lot of lifecycle related work - devops  </li>  
          <li>A lot of APIs</li>  <li> A lot of testing  </li> <li> Salesforce certifications </li> <li>Almost all positions required work experience and most of them required U.S. Citizenship</li>
        <li>Almost every compnay required familiarity with what I am assuming to be company specific tools like SUSE, DICOM, PACS </li> <li> Compute environments like GCP, AWS, AZURE; Agile methodoligies like SDLC, PDLC</li></ul> 
      <br> <br>
      My understanding of the responsibilities:
      I understood that a Solutions Architect ideally designs architecture for software solutions from design to deployment of systems based on business needs analysed by closely working with sales teams. This requires knowledge of databases, cloud computing, having a business perspective and strong communication skills.
